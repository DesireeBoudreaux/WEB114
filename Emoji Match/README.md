# Emoji Match Game

## Overview
This is my final project for **WEB114**.  
It’s a playful memory game where you flip cards to reveal emojis and try to match pairs.  
I used variables, functions, events, conditionals, operators, built‑ins, and DOM manipulation to bring it all together.

## Features
- Flip cards to uncover hidden emojis  
- Match pairs until the board is cleared  
- Custom gradient design (purple and teal)  
- Console logs to make debugging easier  
- Beginner‑friendly code with step‑by‑step logic that’s easy to follow  

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**  
- **CSS3**  
- **JavaScript (ES6)**  

## How to Play
1. Click a card to reveal its emoji.  
2. Pick another card to try for a match.  
3. If they match, they stay flipped.  
4. If not, they’ll flip back after a short delay.  
5. Keep going until you’ve matched all the pairs and cleared the board!
